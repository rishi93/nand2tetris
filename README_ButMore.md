## History of Computers
I figured if you're building your own computer then maybe learning more about
the history of computers is also something you might be interested in.

And just like the Nand2Tetris doesn't assume any pre-existing knowledge, these
courses are also aimed at the motivated layman

Here are some resources:

## Electronics
For the Nand2Tetris course, we started with the basic logic gates like "AND", "OR", "NOT", "XOR",
"NOR", "NAND" and so on...

And these are essentially implemented by electronic switches, but we never delve into
how "electronic switches" themselves work. "Transistors" enter the scene.

Even though there were computers before transistors were discovered. All of this modern computing with powerful yet miniature sized computing devices has been made possible by transistors.

So one should probably start there with understanding how transistors work. For digital computers which are based on boolean logic, you probably only need to understand transistors act as switches
which inturn leads to interesting logic gates.

And if one wants a deep understanding of how transistors themselves work, then you have to get
deep into semiconductor physics. This is where we get really bare-bones and start talking
about various "materials". I put "materials" in quotes because what we are actually
talking about are elements. And you know that all the elements on this planet can be arranged
according to their properties in a nice table called the "periodic table". So you'll have to
start there and then you'll get into how atoms exist and how electrons within those atoms
behave.

Here is a humorous way to get into semiconductor physics:

If you try to understand about how electrons really work, I'm afraid you'll get into the
wonderful and weird world of Quantum Physics. If anyone says they understand Quantum
Physics then they are lying. Richard Feynman is one of those great physicists who could
explain difficult concepts in simple terms, so he could be someone who could help us here
